//DESCRIPTION:
//Your function takes two arguments:
//current father's age (years)
//current age of his son (years)
//Ñalculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son 
//(or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or 
//equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

//SOLUTION:

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  let firstAge = dadYearsOld - sonYearsOld;
  let secondAge = firstAge * 2;
  return Math.abs(dadYearsOld - secondAge);
};
